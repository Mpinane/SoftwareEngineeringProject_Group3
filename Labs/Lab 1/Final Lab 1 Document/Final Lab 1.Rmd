\section{1 Introduction}

\subsection{1.1 Problem Statement}
It is becoming more and more difficult, particularly for students entering graduate schools, to make decisions on courses that subsequently impact on their successful completion of graduate studies. Often, students have to choose from a number of electives in their specific programmes. 

\subsection{1.2 Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to detail the requirements for the Avi system to be developed. It will describe the features, functions and interfaces of the system. This document is intended for developers of the system as this document will serve as a guideline for the development of the Avi system. It is also intended for the client(The University of Witwatersrand) and serves as an indication of what the client should expect from the developed system. The approval of this document will be interpreted as permission to go ahead with the development of the system.  

\subsection{1.3 Scope}
Avi is a web application that will recommend elective courses to prospective postgraduate students and further predict the grades the students are likely to get in the recommended courses based on their grades in previously completed courses.

A student will start by creating an account which includes specifying their firstname, lastname, student number and their login password.

Once a student has created an account they can only be able to get recommendations once they have added the courses they have done, the year the course was completed along with the grade they obtained in each course. This information can be updated by the student for cases where they may have made a mistake or their mark has changed.

The student can now request to get recommendations. After requesting to get a recommendation, the student must specify the level of study they want recommendations for. After this the system will present to them the recommended courses along with the predicted grade for each course.

\newpage

\subsection{1.7 Overview }
*Existing System:*

* Currently students make their own decisions on which electives to take in that specific year of study.

* They use their own gut feeling to choose elective courses. On the other hand the faculty as well as their parents do not have the required domain knowledge to help them choose the right elective courses. 

*Existing System:*

* Bad choice of elective courses can have a direct impact on that student's academic performance.

* It can further limit the student's ability to reach their future goals in other words this will simply demoralize the student.

* In the end this results to students dropping out of courses in the middle of each semester.


*Our Plan:*

* Registration - unregistered users of the system will be able to register so that they can access to the system.
* Login - after successful registration users a required to login using their created username and password.
* A registered user/student is then able to insert the courses they are currently taking or have taken together with their mark to be captured by the system.
* Get/view recommendation - a student.
* A registered user should also be able to reset password.

\section{2 Overall Description}

\subsection{2.1 Product Perspective}

The Avi system is the first of its kind at the University of Witwatersrand. It is independent and totally self contained. Currently recommendations are provided by the faculty based on their observations of other students’ performance there is no formal or reliable system or methods for providing these recommendations.
\newpage

\subsection{2.2 User Interface}

*Login Page:*

  + For honours or masters based on user selection.

*Possible Outputs:*

* Recommended Courses.

* Expected Grades.

The Student Profile consists of the student’s Firstname, Lastname, Student number and their password.
The undergraduate results should be integers ranging from 0 – 100 and will be directly linked/ related to output i. Computer Science undergraduate courses are higher ranked in the decision-making process, the supplementary courses are considered after and then final decision is made from a calculated weighing of the main and supplementary courses of the results.

\subsection{3.3 Functions}

* The system shall check the validity of data.
* The system shall handle errors and invalid data.
* The system shall check for data overflow, check that the number of simultaneous user access request can be handled to avoid malfunction, bugs and system crashes.
* The system shall be logged to monitor admin access and security breaches.
* The system shall use data mining techniques to properly group students into clusters accordingly.
* The system shall use formulas for calculating expected grades derived from previous similar students using techniques such as statistical correlation.
* The system shall then recommend courses which the student may consider choosing.
* The system shall return expected grades for those recommended courses.

\subsection{3.4 Performance Requirements}

* The system is not expected to handle unreasonably large amounts of data.

* The system will expect integer values for academic results and will avoid string inputs using drop down selection and similar implementations.

* The system will be able to process student input - clusters comparisons within two minutes from run time.

* The system will be able to accommodate up to 1000 simultaneous users.

\newpage

\subsection{3.5 Logical Database Requirements}

*Type of variables to be used in database:*

* Integers.
* Converted Strings.
* Protected Strings.
* Floats

Variables will be checked for validity and range correspondence. 
Variables such as integers will have a higher frequency retrieval from the database. 
Sensitive information already in the database such as identity and student numbers should be locked from retrieval and have limited access – such as admin access only.

\subsection{3.6 System Software Requirements}

* The system should keep checkpoints every 6 hours and restart daily at an allocated time -preferably at night- to avoid malfunctions.
* The system should check for errors on a regular interval and use checkpoints to recover from any error if needed.
* The system will keep security logs to verify admin access, user access attempts, and privilege information access.
* The system should check for data integrity to avoid corrupted and malicious data for critical variables.
* The system should utilize cryptographic techniques for database encryption such as RSA encryption or Prime Factorization.

\subsection{3.7 Design Constraints}

* The system will be design using python on the django framework.

* The system must comply with the IEEE standards.

\subsection{3.8 Other Requirements}

Data retention and other user specific data related storage will not be implemented and user information will be deleted as soon as they deactivate or delete their account off the server.

\newpage

\section{4 Gathering and Preparing Data}

## Data Collection and Preparation

* Since the project is still in its preliminary phase, artifitial data will be generated to keep the project going, however as the project progresses it is worth noting that real data must be used to ensure that the trained machine learning classifier is properly validated.

* It is convenient to work with data that is artificially generated, it saves us from cleaning the data and performing all the data mangling techniques as well as slicing and dicing features.

* Upon generating the datasets, we can take care of the following cases:
  + Ensure that there are no duplicates in the CSV files.
  + Ensure that all the rows have data associated with the corresponding features(*There are no missing values*)
  
* One primitive hoslistic approach that will be used to generate the datasets is *string manipulation*, *string manipulation* involves processing or transforming string objects into a desired format or structure. One way of achieving this, is using regular expressions.

* To increase cohesion between features, we may consider to not include outliers in the generated datasets, on the other hand we must impose some constraints on the values that are taken by the features.

* To give some sense into our data , we must consider using probability distributions, and focus widely on distributed values.

* New datasets can be derived by merging datasets that are already created some primitive functions that can be used to merge datasets include:
  + Concatenation
  + Join
  + Merge

## Data Analysis and Model Selection

* Before choosing any classifier to use as a predictor, we need to carefully analyze the generated datasets and visually represent the data using various graphical methods. We need to carefully inspect each feature.

* As part of our preliminary techniques, we will start brute forcing the problem by using the following machine learning techniques:
  + Logistic Regression
  + K-Means Clustering
  
* *Logistic Regression-*Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.

* *K-Means Clustering-*K-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters.

\newpage

\section{5 The Dataset}

*STUDENTS DATA*

* The student dataset contains approximately 5494 artifitially generated students information. The information include , each student's ID, Name, Surname and the current year completed.

*FIRST_YEAR DATA*

* The first year dataset contains approximately 10 real first year Computer Science course codes as well as their descriptions.
