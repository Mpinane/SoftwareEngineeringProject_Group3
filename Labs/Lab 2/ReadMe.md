## Lab IIB Prime Number Generator:


## 1.Project Description:

We have developed and implemented a function PrimeNumbers() that takes a positive
integer number X, and generates all prime numbers less than or equal to X. We have also included a main program that serves as a test-driver to test various scenarios of possible misuse and proper use of this module. Error codes are to be returned if invalid inputs are taken in by the module. 

#### The complete report is found under SoftwareEngineeringProject_Group3/Labs/Lab 2/Final Lab 2 Document/Final_Lab_2.pdf


## 2.Prerequisites:

The program requires python 3 to be executed. The Program was implemented and tested using a Linux based terminal. 


## 3.Installing:

In the Code folder(SoftwareEngineeringProject_Group3/Labs/Lab 2/Code/
) we run the tests with the command: python test_Generator.py
This checks, tests and returns all test cases for the PrimeGenerator.py file. 

The tester is required to run: pip install -r requirements.txt which will installs all  required dependencies and external libraries apart from python 3.

In the Alternate folder(SoftwareEngineeringProject_Group3/Labs/Lab 2/Code/Alternate/
) there is a PrimeGen.py file and a test_PrimeGen.py file.
The PrimeGen.py file is incorporated and tested in the test_PrimeGen.py file so we only need to run the test file to test the program.

To run the test_PrimeGen.py type in the terminal: python -m unittest test_PrimeGen

To generate and plot the performance graph: python performance_test.py
The data folder provides a directory for inputFile = open("performance_test_inputfile.txt",'r') which is in line 23 in performance_test.py


## 4.Features:

The program intends to tests our Prime Number Generator function and return an array containing all prime numbers below X, where X is an array of possible inputs. The function also returns the generated prime number array length.


## 5.Test Break Down:

Unit testing is performed to check the functions reliability and functionality. This is explained extensively in final_lab_2.pdf under SoftwareEngineeringProject_Group3/Labs/Lab 2/Final Lab 2 Document.
Refer to 3. for instructions on how to run the test file.
