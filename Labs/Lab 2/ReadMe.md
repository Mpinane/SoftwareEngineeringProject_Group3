## Lab IIB Prime Number Generator:

1.Project Description:

We have developed and implemented a function PrimeNumbers() that takes a positive
integer number X, and generates all prime numbers less than or equal to X. We have also included a main program that serves as a test-driver to test various scenarios of possible misuse and proper use of this module. Error codes are to be returned if invalid inputs are taken in by the module.


2.Prerequisites:

The program requires python 3 to be executed. The Program was implemented and tested using a Linux based terminal. 


3.Installing:

In the Alternate folder there is a PrimeGen.py file and a test_PrimeGen.py file.
The PrimeGen.py file is incorporated and tested in the test_PrimeGen.py file so we only need to run the test file to test the program.

To run the test_PrimeGen.py type in the terminal: python -m unittest test_PrimeGen


4.Features:

The program intends to tests our Prime Number Generator function and return an array containing all prime numbers below X, where X is considerable array of possible inputs. The function also returns the generated prime number array length.


5.Break down into end to end tests

Unit testing is performed to check the functions reliability and functionality. This is explained extensively in final_lab_2 under SoftwareEngineeringProject_Group3/Labs/Lab 2/Final Lab 2 Document.
Refer to 3. for instructions on how to run the test file.
